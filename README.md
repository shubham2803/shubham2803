## Hi, I'm Shubham 👋

Senior Backend Engineer focused on building boring, reliable systems.

I work mostly on:
- Distributed backend systems
- Asynchronous pipelines & eventual consistency
- Failure handling, retries, and idempotency
- Pragmatic infrastructure choices (ops > hype)

### 📌 Case Study
👉 [**How I Redesigned a Synchronous Pipeline into an Asynchronous, Eventually Consistent System**](https://github.com/shubham2803/system-design-notes/blob/main/async-pipeline-eventual-consistency.md)

This is a real-world write-up from a production system I owned, covering:
- Why strong consistency was hurting reliability
- How async + events improved scalability
- Idempotency, retries, DLQs, and compensation
- Observability and operational trade-offs
